# VDS-Sample-Configuration-2023

Vault 2023 Data Standard Configuration Samples for Vault Professional (Workgroup)

--- VDS-2022-Manufacturing-Sample - see also Releases section for configuration packages.--- This configuration sample applies to Vaults based on the default "Manufacturing" behavior configuration. It is also tested in the Vault "PDMC-Sample" environment available for Autodesk Channel Partners. It demonstrates a full customized approach for all DataSheets, Tabs and Menu Commands. Additional features like Shortcuts in VDS for CAD, or Tools like "Reserve-Numbers" share insights on how to implement extended functionality or additional tools and command to VDS clients.

--- VDS-2022-PDMC-Sample-Configuration --- Note - This extended configuration sample requires a dedicated Vault behavior configuration, called "PDMC-Sample"; it is available to Autodesk Channel Partners only. The configuration includes everything of VDS-20xx-Manufacturing-Sample but targets comprehensive VDS feature additions and Vault API consumption.

I created and maintain this configuration samples as an employee of Autodesk. However, Autodesk nor I represent that these samples are reliable, accurate, complete, or otherwise valid in other environments. Accordingly, those configuration samples are provided "as is" with no warranty of any kind, and you use the applications at your own risk.

Sincerely,
